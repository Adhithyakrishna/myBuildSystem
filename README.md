# myBuildSystem
  Builds a production ready app in a go !!. (supports development environment too)

# Options for CSS
  1) Converts SCSS to css.
  2) Includes precompiler for the last 5 versions of famous browsers (yaaay!!).
  3) Concatenates all css and include only a single css file for production

# Options for Js
  1) Seperate folder to include preload scripts (scripts that has to be rendered before other scripts eg. Jquery, plugins)
  2) Validates js (no more missing semicolon during commit yaay)!!
  3) Minifies all the js files and includes only a single js for production.

# Watch
  1) Watches for changes and does both css tasks and js tasks for each save made inside the folder. Success?

# Let's start building
 
 ☐ chrome://flags/#enable-devtools-experiments - enable this and unleash awesomeness.

 ☐ Install node js

 ✔ For sass plugin to work, we need ruby, download and install from https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
     
 ✔ Fan of classic compass? download the compass from  http://compass-style.org/help/ 
 
 ✔ npm install --global postcss-cli autoprefixer
 
 ✔ Goes well with any local server, but I would recommend using http server, comes along with node install http server from https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
     
#HAPPY BUILDING!!
